            <p>I am finding the University of Pennsylvania's Coding Boot Camp both very challenging, distressing and stimulting at the same time. When code works it's a triumph. When it does not it is perplexing. Working with with an updated tool-set was challenging at first and the  learning curve to use them efficiently was a daunting challenge. The time I spent making them my own, made me have to play catch up with coding.</p>
            <p>It's better now and I look forward to the next challenge knocking at my door. My pencant for organization has been a benefit as I would have been lost and probable long gone without it.</p>
